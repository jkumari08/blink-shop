## Project Description

BlinkShop is a two-sided social commerce platform:

**Merchants** create shareable product cards (Blinks) in seconds - no website needed.

**Buyers** click a Blink on X, Discord, or Reddit → select a token → approve → done in 400ms. No leaving the platform.

**Why it matters:**
- Traditional e-commerce: See post → Click link → Navigate website → Checkout → Wait days → Merchant loses 2-3% + $0.30
- BlinkShop: Click → Approve → Done in 400ms on Solana at $0.001/tx
